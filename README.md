# LRU-cache
This program demonstrates the fuctionality of LRU (Least Recently Used) cache.
Cache is high speed memory from where data can be accessed very quickly.
If some data is not found in the cache (cache miss), then the l'least recently used' data is removed and the new data is added.
If the required data is found (cache hit), then it is moved to the top, denoting its high importance.
Hashmap and Linked List have been used for its implementation.
